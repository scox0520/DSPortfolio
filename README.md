## Welcome to my DS portfolio!

This is a collection of projects I've worked on to demonstrate skills and to explore things of interest to me. My main interests collide at the intersection of urban development, housing/transit, and urban political economy. Further writing samples can be found on my website.


## Contents

 - #### Corporate Neighbors: Corporate investment into single family housing in the Twin Cities region
    -  Preprocessing TC Parcels: Cleaning and harmonizing parcel data from the seven county metro area. Identified single family, small multi-family, and large-multifamily residential housing. Identifyied corporate ownership based on tax name.
    - Preprocessing TC tracts: Create social, demographic, economic, housing and place-based dataset based on geography to explore corporate investment relative to other spatial patterns in the Twin Cities region.
    - TC EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis to examine geographical patterns of explanatory variable, spatial auto-correlation (statistically significant spatial clustering), and correlation between variables. Explore the spatial distribution and clustering of corporate investment based on geography and time period. Identify variables important for modeling.
    - TC Modeling: Using classification logistic model to understand odds of a single family home being acquired by a corporate landlord
    - Report: Report created to detail main findings

 - #### BIXI Analysis: A project used to practice generating SQL queries to understand patterns of customer use of the Bixi Bikeshare Program in Montreal

 - #### Sentiment Analysis: Use of NLP algorithms to generate a sentiment analysis to predict positive or negative reviews for hotels in five European cities
    - Phase 1: Data Preparation
    - Phase 2: Application of ML classification methods
  
## In Progress
 - Further ML modeling of corporate housing data in the Twin Cities
 - Analysis of changes in the geographical class structure of the Puget Sound and Twin Cities metro since the neoliberal revolution in the 1980s
 - Spatial analysis and predictive modeling of the 2016 election
 - Time Series analysis of transportation patterns
